# Angular & Spring Boot Project

Hi! This is My personal portfolio webApp. This is the backend developed in Spring boot Java.

To organize my work as an Agile Company I'm using thee free plan of Atlassian Jira (https://rob-portfolio.atlassian.net).

Above the specific of how it works ðŸ˜‰

### Backend side
As I said, the backend of the project is developed in Java with Spring boot.
I'm using Heroku to host my application and the URL is https://rob-portoflio-1997.herokuapp.com/

### Frontend side
The frontend is developed using Angular 12.
I could have used Heroku also for the frontend, integrating with npm but, just to have a wider range of tools I decided to
use Firebase and the URL is https://myportfolio-6a771.web.app/


### Database
For the dataBase I have two choice.
  - The first one is to use my personal Raspberry that I've properly configured to host my DB (http://ourlists.ddns.net:3306/myprofile)
  - The second is to use a database that I've created on a SiteGround hosted website that I've created last year for my parent's Butchery
